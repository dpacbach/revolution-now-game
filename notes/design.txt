Game loops:

  start of turn:

    Iterate through the colonies, for each:

      * advance state of the colony

      * display messages to user any/or show animations where necessary

      * allow them to enter colony when events happens; in that case
        go to the colony screen game loop.  When the user exits the
        colony screen then this colony iteration immediately proceeds;
        i.e., user cannot enter any other colonies.  This prevents the
        user from making last-minute changes to colonies that have not
        yet been advanced in this turn (otherwise that might allow
        cheating in some way).

      * during this time, the user is not free to scroll
        map (menus?) or make any changes to units.  They are also
        not allowed to enter colonies apart from the one that has
        just been processed.

    Advance the state of the old world, possibly displaying messages
    to the user where necessary.

    Iterate through all units, for each:

      * if it is it in `goto` mode focus on it and advance it
      * if it is a ship on the high seas then advance it
          if it has arrived in the old world then jump to the old world
          screen (maybe ask user whether they want to ignore),
          which has its own game loop (see old-world loop).
      * if it is in the old world then ignore it, or possibly remind
        the user it is there.
      * if it is performing an action, such as building a road,
        advance the state.  If it finishes then mark it as active
        so that it will wait for orders in the next step.
      * if it is in an indian village then advance it, and mark
        it active if it is finished.

      * if unit is waiting for orders then focus on it, and enter
        a realtime game loop where the user can interact with the
        map and GUI in general.  See `unit orders` game loop.

      * Make AI moves
          Make European moves
          Make Native moves
          Make expeditionary force moves

          Might want to do this in the Processing loop

      * if no player units needed orders then show a message somewhere
        that says "end of turn" and let the user interact with the
        map and GUI.

  Unit orders game loop:

    while state != unit accepted orders:

      render:
        render the the world without any units on it.  Color cycling
        animations here will use SDL_GetTicks to decide animation state.

        render all the colonies

        render all the units, with the focus animation using SDL_GetTicks
        to decide animation state.

      if state == unit awaiting orders && if input received:
        check if input valid
        if so then iniate movement animation, setting state to animation.
        ? need to figure this out more, but initially skip animations ?

      if state == animation:
        advance animation; if animation finished the mark state as
        `unit accepted orders`

      delay to maintain frame rate

  End of turn game loop:

  Colony screen game loop:

  Old World game loop:

  Message-window-over-world game loop:

    * This needs needs to be able to show a message and let the
      user interact with it while possibly still showing animations
      on the map in the background, but not letting the user interact
      with the map.

  Unit animation game loop: (needed?)

    * This includes sliding units and animations resulting from
      e.g. city upgrades.

  Processing game loop:

    * Any intensive processing task should probably be done in
      a separate thread with a loop running so that things remain
      responsive.
