  # building on production in terms of percent increases. Note
  # that the base value to which the percentage is applied here
  # may or may not include the base/free production, depending on
  # what we're talking about. For example, the percent bonus for
  # a Cathedral does not seem to apply to the base production of
  # the building, while the percent bonus of a Printing Press and
  # Newspaper do seem to get applied to the base production. Note
  # that the original game appears to ROUND DOWN on 1/2.
