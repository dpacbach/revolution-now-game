-- The possible commands that can be sent to the midi thread.
-- Generally, after receiving one of these commands the midi
-- thread will update its state.
--
--   play:   Start playing the given tune from the beginning,
--           even if the player was paused.
--
--   stop:   Stop playing (if playing).  If playing, position in
--           current tune will be lost.  Playing must be resumed
--           with a `play` command.
--
--   pause:  Pause the player wherever it is, whether in the
--           middle of a tune or in the middle of tracks.
--
--   pause:  Resume the player if it was paused.
--
--   off:    Tell the player to turn off.
--
--   volume: Set the master volume from 0.0 to 1.0.  The value
--           1.0 corresponds to the value in the MIDI file, so
--           therefore this can really only be used to lower
--           the volume.  Gain beyond the standard volume would
--           need to be done with the synthesizer.
