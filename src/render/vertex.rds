struct.GenericVertex {
  # The type of object that this vertex is a part of.  Possible
  # value are:
  #
  #  0. Sprite. This triangle will be filled in with a sprite
  #     from the texture atlas as-is.
  #
  #  1. Solid rectangle. This triangle will be filled in with a
  #     solid color.
  #
  #  2. Silhouette. This triangle will be contain a sprite copied
  #     from the texture atlas, but all of its non-transparent
  #     pixels will be replaced by a fixed color. Examples of
  #     uses for this would be fonts and window shadows.
  #
  #  The above options should be in order of decreasing probabil-
  #  ity, that way most shaders can return early most of the time
  #  and won't spend time testing for unlikely branches.
  type 'int32_t',

  # bool. If this is zero then the vertex will be discarded. This
  # can be used e.g. for unit blinking animations.
  visible 'int32_t',

  # Depixelation. This triangle will have individual pixels ran-
  # domly removed depending on the stage of the animation, which
  # is given by the value of this parameter: 0 means fully vis-
  # ible (no depixelation), 1.0 means fully invisible.
  depixelate 'float',

  # Position of the vertex in game coordinates, i.e. where one
  # unit corresponds to one logical pixel and where the origin is
  # at the upper left of the screen and y increases downward.
  position 'gl::vec2',

  # For triangles that get filled in with a texture, this will be
  # the coordinates of the vertex in the texture atlas.
  atlas_position 'gl::vec2',

  # When depixelation is on (i.e., depixelate > 0.0), and if this
  # coordinate is other than zero, then it will be interpreted as
  # an offset from the atlas_position to another position in the
  # texture atlas where the target color should be taken. Effec-
  # tively, this allows a sprite to "depixelate" into another
  # sprite, as opposed to depixelating to nothing as is the de-
  # fault when this offset is zero.
  atlas_target_offset 'gl::vec2',

  # For solid triangles or silhouettes this will be the color
  # used. Components should be in [0, 1.0]. For silhouettes,
  # alpha in this color will be multiplied by the alpha of the
  # texture pixel.
  fixed_color 'gl::color',

  # The final pixel color will have its alpha multiplied by this
  # value (no matter how it was produced). Should be in [0, 1].
  alpha_multiplier 'float',

  # This is a rescaling; the `position` attribute will be multi-
  # plied by this value. A value of 1.0 is a no-op.
  scaling 'float',

  # This is a translation; the `position` attribute will be added
  # to this value after scaling. A value of 0.0 is a no-op.
  translation 'gl::vec2',

  # Need this in all vertex structs since OpenGL needs to have
  # the offsets of each member of the struct.
  _features { equality, offsets }
