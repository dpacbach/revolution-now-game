# Effective terrain. This is the one that is most directly rele-
# vant for game mechanics. Each square will have precisely one
# value for this enum. This one is not needed for rendering, but
# is useful for resource and movement calculations, since those
# quantities (in particular, for forested types) cannot simply be
# derived by knowing the ground terrain and forest status.
