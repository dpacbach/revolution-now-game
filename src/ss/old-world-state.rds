  # In the OG you can rush the recruitment of an immigrant in the
  # immigrant pool by clicking on the Recruit button in the
  # harbor view. When this happens, the game computes a price
  # that depends on a baseline price along with an additional
  # term that depends on how many recruits have been rushed to
  # date in the game (each subsequent one increases that term).
  # The result of this is that the zero-crossess price of a rush
  # recruitment increases on each rush recruitment, and never
  # again decreases. That said, the actual price of a rushed re-
  # cruitment can be (almost) arbitrarily low by just accumu-
  # lating the necessary amount of crosses. But once a recruit-
  # ment happens via cross accumulation, the price resets again
  # to the higher value determined by the number of total rushed
  # recruits.

  # conditions (such as the year, and number of colonies) to see
  # if it is greenlighted to trigger a tax event. If so it will
  # trigger one. But either way it will recompute this number and

# This holds the state of old-world related things. That
# includes:
#
#   * The harbor UI state.
#   * The state of the king and parent country.
#   * The prices of commodities in the old world.
#   * The size of the expeditionary force.
#
# It is not a
# top-level state because there is one for each player, so it is
# more natural to just embed it in the Player object. That said,
# it is also nice to have it in its own struct grouping.
