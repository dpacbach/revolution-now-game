  # dwelling-level anger (alarm). According to the manual:
  # "Overall tribal anger is affected by direct action you take
  # against the Indians. Alarm in individual settlements is af-
  # fected not by direct action, but by indirect pressures such
  # as your proximity to that settlement, the size of your
  # colony, the presence of weapons, and so on."
