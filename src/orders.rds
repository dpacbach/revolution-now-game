# An `orders_t` is a general term describing what the player pro-
# poses that a unit do when the unit asks the player. Roughly
# speaking, it captures the input that the player gives when the
# unit is waiting for orders. This could include "wait", "goto
# tile X", "move to tile X", "forfeight movement points", "plow
# square", "build colony". orders_t only represent what the
# player has proposed, and so it makes sense to talk about orders
# that are not permitted. For example, the player might give or-
# ders to a unit to "move left", but doing so might cause a land
# unit to go into a sea square without a ship, which would not be
# allowed. In that case, the orders are not allowed.
