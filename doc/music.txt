Music
=====

Music will work as follows:

  - Music will be stored in a dedicated rn-music repo.
  - In the repo the music will be stored as midi files.
  - The game will use some third party libraries to read the midi
    files and to send them to a midi port for playing. There will
    have to be a softsynth server running to play them, such as
    fluidsynth:
      - libsmf to read the midi files
      - rtmidi to send them to the midi port
  - Releases of the game will instead hold its music in the form
    of ogg files, since these are apparently better than mp3 but
    are supported by SDL. The process of preparing a release
    process will include using fluidsynth to generate wav files
    from the midi files and to then convert the wav files to ogg
    files, that way official releases of the game do not have to
    have the capability of playing midi files, since this would
    require:
      - shipping the game with the sound font (which might not be
        allowed depending on which sound font we end up using).
      - linking the game with e.g. libfluidsynth, and then wor-
        rying about either shipping a copy of it with the game or
        requiring the user to have it installed (neither is ide-
        al).
