Plan
========================================================

0) Finish menus:
     * hot keys
     * names with highlighted hotkey
1) Looks like we are creating textures with
   SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET; see if removing this from
   the sprites speeds up copying.
2) Add disband command
3) Fix handling of multiple units on a square with
   rendering and combat.
4) Finish ship combat
5) Implement mouse selection of units to e.g. activate.
6) Add a cache to the cache module that invalidates
   when the scaling is changed.  This will facilitate
   the next item.
7) Modify the `screen` module to handle all quantities
   that depend on the rendering scale, and allow dynamic
   changes to it.  Also try to fix non-fullscreen mode.
8) Remove color palette from config, generate a new
   palette data structure with a uniform distribution
   of hues/sats/lums.  Kind of rediculous to have the
   palette in a ucl file.
9) Animate water by sliding the pixels within each water
   sprite in a given direction (and wrapping around).
   This is essentially rotating the pixels, but rotating
   about an axis that is within the plane of the screen.

Long Term Plan
========================================================

* Finish basic game mechanics

* Implement europe

* Implement game saves with scripted testing.

    * Will need to gather up all global state into a
      central location and then serialize using UCL.
