  * Here is a good forum thread explaining the algorithm used for
    price movement in civ4-col. It is somewhat different from the
    original game, and there is discussion on its shortcomings.
    Our game does not use this exact model, but it is good for
    comparison.

Processed Goods Price Group
===========================

In the original game, the four processed goods (rum, cigars,
cloth, and coats) don't seem to follow the same economic model as
the other goods. Instead, their prices are linked to each other
(confirmed by experimentation and the strategy guide) and evolve
according to a very different mechanism.

Generally speaking, it seems that the goal of the designers of
the original game were to encourage selling all four of the goods
instead of just a single one repeatedly. To this end, no matter
how much you sell, the prices will not drop as long as you sell
all four goods. The fewer types of goods you sell, the more the
prices will drop. This is implemented by tying the prices of the
four goods together in such a way that when one goes down, the
others go up. The game tries to maintain a fixed average of the
prices of the four goods.

  * Out of the parameters from the normal model for other goods,
    these are the ones that seem to play a role in the price
    group model:

      * ask_price_start_min:  ignored
      * ask_price_start_max:  ignored
      * ask_price_min:        yes (same role)
      * ask_price_max:        yes (same role)
      * bid_ask_spread:       yes (same role)
      * rise:                 yes (but plays different role)
      * fall:                 yes (but plays different role)
      * attrition:            ignored
      * volatility:           yes (same role)
