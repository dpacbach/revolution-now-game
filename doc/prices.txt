  * Here is a good forum thread explaining the algorithm used for
    price movement in civ4-col. It is somewhat different from the
    original game, and there is discussion on its shortcomings.
    Our game does not use this exact model, but it is good for
    comparison.

Processed Goods Price Group
===========================

In the original game, the four processed goods (rum, cigars,
cloth, and coats) don't seem to follow the same economic model as
the other goods. Instead, their prices are linked to each other
(confirmed by experimentation and the strategy guide) and evolve
according to a very different mechanism.
The precise algo-
rithm is not known, but the following are some empirical observa-
tions.

Generally speaking, it seems that the goal of the designers of
the original game were to prevent all four of the goods from
having very high prices and all four from having very low prices.
This may have been done in order to ensure that, as time moves
on, the average total value that can be obtained by selling the
four goods remains constant, but only if they are traded in
roughly equal proportions.

  * Out of the parameters from the normal model for other goods,
    these are the ones that seem to play a role in the price
    group model:

      * ask_price_start_min:  no
      * ask_price_start_max:  no
      * ask_price_min:        yes (same role)
      * ask_price_max:        yes (same role)
      * bid_ask_spread:       yes (same role)
      * rise:                 yes (but plays different role)
      * fall:                 yes (but plays different role)
      * attrition:            ?
      * volatility:           yes (same role)

  * Generally, the game appears to try to maintain the sum of the
    bid prices for these four goods at around ~42.
  * If the price of one good is driven down by some means, then
    the other three are driven up to compensate.
  * In some cases, selling one of these goods can cause its price
    to rise, clearly implying that the usual mechanism is not
    being employed.
  * When all of the goods' prices are roughly equal and the sum
    is above 42, selling can easily make the all drop.
  * When all of the goods' prices are roughly equal and the sum
    is above 42, buying the goods in round robin fashion causes
    no price movement at all.
  * When all of the goods' prices are roughly equal and the sum
    is about 42, you can buy an arbitrarily large quantity of a
    single good and the price will never rise.
  * The ability to make a price move as a result of a buy or sell
    is easier if that action puts the sum closer to 42.
  * If all of the prices all very low (e.g. 1) then they all rise
    by one each turn until they all get to about 10.
  * If all of the prices all very high (e.g. 19) then they all
    fall by one each turn until they all get to about 10.
  * When one is at 13 and we try to lower the others to zero with
    a volatility of 1 then they seem to hit a floor of about 7.
    This also happens with a volatility of 2. But with a
    volatility of three then can be brought down to zero.
  * When two of them are at the max price and two are at the min
    price, then the two low ones will start increasing until the
    sum gets to about 50.
  * When two are at the min price and two are much higher but not
    at the max price, then the two that are not at the max will
    go up.
  * Start with all the prices roughy equal (around 9-11), and
    start selling all the goods in a round robin fashion. Ob-
