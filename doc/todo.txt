  1. spdlog may be very slow to include, see:
     https://github.com/s9w/cpp-lit
     Need to get rid of this library.

# ===============================================================
# Lua
# ===============================================================

  1. Create proper Lua API design in order to avoid coupling with
     the C++ modules.
  2. Generate Flatbuffers Lua modules so that Lua can read and
     write game save files.
  3. Add some other standard containers like vector,
     unordered_map, etc.

# ===============================================================
# TODO
# ===============================================================

  1. Move all global save-game data into one giant data structure
     and get all the SG stuff out of the individual modules.

# Bugs

Low priority:

  - When we toggle from fullscreen to non-fullscreen the mouse
    position is a bit off. This is probably some kind of SDL
    issue where the window thinks that it is in a different posi-
    tion than where it is displayed on screen (off by about 10-20
    pixels). As soon as the window position is moved slightly (by
    dragging) then it is observed to self-correct. Somehow, after
    restoring the window, we need to tell the window to update
    itself.

# ===============================================================
# Build System
# ===============================================================

  - Add support for precompiled headers.  CMake recently added
    this feature and it should be available in a version post
    3.15.x (probably 3.16+).  See:

      https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/commit/fa36e2151d25358c7946a53c4440f0487210770d

  - Add Windows support.

# ===============================================================
# Infrastructure
# ===============================================================

  - Consider replacing any string-joining stuff with fmt::join,
    but first see if it will be included in C++20.

  - Add a generic texture cache to the cache module that can
    cache textures. It will also support pruning and/or automatic
    regeneration.

  - Add a cache to the cache module that invalidates when the
    scaling is changed. This may not be necessary since, as of
    now, it seems possible to write code that will work and ad-
    just to any scale.

# Basic Game Mechanics
# ===============================================================

  - Fix handling of multiple units on a square with combat.
  - Finish ship combat

  List of basic game mechanics:

    * All Units

        x sentry
        - goto
        x wait / forfeight
        x moving to friendly squares
        x click on unit to clear orders / open orders window.
        x disband

    * Land Units

        x fortifying
        x military unit attacking military unit
        x military unit attacking civilian
        - military unit attacking trade wagon / treasure
        - unit moving into lost city

    * Ships

        - ship attacking ship (evade, damage, sink)
        - privateer stealth

    * Land Units + Ships

        x ship holding units
        x land unit boarding ship
        x landfall
        - treasure boarding ship
