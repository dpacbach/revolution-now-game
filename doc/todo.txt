TODO
=================================================================

  - Add a cache to the cache module that invalidates when the
    scaling is changed. This will facilitate the next item.
  - Modify the `screen` module to handle all quantities that de-
    pend on the rendering scale, and allow dynamic changes to it,
    still fullscreen.
  - Allow non-fullscreen mode, window resizing, and automatic ad-
    justing of scale.

  - Allow multiple windows.
  - Test unit selection window with end-of-turn window.
  - Quick workaround to avoid end-of-turn window.
  - Make windows model.

=================================================================
UI
=================================================================

  - Next Turn button
  - Escape cancels Ok/Cancel windows.
  - Minimap

=================================================================
Rendering
=================================================================

  - Fix handling of multiple units on a square with rendering.

  - Draw the popup window background consisting of a wood texture
    and a cloth sign hanging from the top with the title (this
    will be common to all windows), and then have a view that
    does the word-wrapped/markup text in the middle.

  - Animate water by sliding the pixels within each water sprite
    in a given direction (and wrapping around). This is essen-
    tially rotating the pixels, but rotating about an axis that
    is within the plane of the screen. Either this, or find an-
    other way to animate it.

Basic Game Mechanics
=================================================================

  - Fix handling of multiple units on a square with combat.
  - Finish ship combat

  List of basic game mechanics:

    * All Units

        x sentry
        - goto
        x wait / forfeight
        x moving to friendly squares
        x click on unit to clear orders / open orders window.
        x disband

    * Land Units

        x fortifying
        x military unit attacking military unit
        x military unit attacking civilian
        - military unit attacking trade wagon / treasure
        - unit moving into lost city

    * Ships

        - ship attacking ship (evade, damage, sink)
        - privateer stealth

    * Land Units + Ships

        x ship holding units
        x land unit boarding ship
        x landfall
        - treasure boarding ship

=================================================================
Game Save / Replay
=================================================================

  - data structure to hold game state

=================================================================
Old World View
=================================================================

  - Determine layout of europe background image
  - high seas
  - player gold
  - tax rate
  - old world view
  - unit immigration
  - purchasing units

=================================================================
Frame Control / Animations
=================================================================

  - Create an animation module that handles managing elapsed time
    for animations and scrolling so that the feel of the inter-
    face will not change with framerate.

=================================================================
Cargo
=================================================================

  - ship can hold cargo
  - europe sells cargo

=================================================================
Terrain
=================================================================

  - movement affected by terrain
  - pioneer plow
  - pioneer road

=================================================================
Colonies
=================================================================

  - Determine layout of europe background image

=================================================================
Game Narrative
=================================================================

  - game year/season
  - royal army

=================================================================
Graphics Engine
=================================================================

  - Looks like we are creating textures with
    SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET; see if removing this from the
    sprites speeds up copying.

  - Add a cache to the cache module that invalidates when the
    scaling is changed. This will facilitate the next item.

  - Modify the `screen` module to handle all quantities that de-
    pend on the rendering scale, and allow dynamic changes to it.
    Also try to fix non-fullscreen mode.

  - Remove color palette from config, generate a new palette data
    structure with a uniform distribution of hues/sats/lums. Kind
    of rediculous to have the palette in a ucl file.

=================================================================
Build System
=================================================================

  - Add Windows support.

=================================================================
Testing
=================================================================

  - Add catch2 and start adding unit tests
  - Add a fuzz tester and fuzz test the markup parser
