Land View Rendering Performance Analysis
========================================

----------

Did some tests on Leopard with rendering 32k sprites in a grid
(from the same texture) in various ways and measured max frame
rate:

  * Framerate when reconstructing vertex buffer from scratch each
    frame was:                                                     16
  * Framerate when reusing vertex buffer but uploading it every
    frame (using glBufferSubData) was:                             880
  * Framerate when reusing vertex buffer but uploading it every
    frame (using glBufferData) was:                                900
  * Framerate when reusing vertex buffer and not uploading it
    every frame was:                                               2315
