    Jefferson may not apply here. If he did then his bonus would
    have to be factored in between steps 1 and 2 and the result
    would have to be rounded down. This is possible, but the docs
    also say that his bonus only increases the bell production of
    statesmen, which might mean that it doesn't apply to the auto
    bell production.
