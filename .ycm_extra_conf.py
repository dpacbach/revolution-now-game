# specify them with -I on the compile commandline. However, when
# calling libclang.so it will not autmatically use those. This is
# bad because YCM will try to deduce what they are and then ap-
# pend them (with -isystem ...) to the commandline which can mess
# things up when it gets it wrong. So in this function we invoke
# the compiler binary and get it to tell us what the search paths
# are so we can later append them manually to the commandline
